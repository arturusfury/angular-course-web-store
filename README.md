# Template Store Angular Demo

This repo is from a course on building multiple pages in Angular.  Here I used
the angular-seed repo hosted here on github to create our framework then I
built the page up using some basic bootstrap html and angular route knowledge.

It has a working main store page using a json file to simulate our backend
database system, then has a details page for each template allowing you to look
in more detail about each image before purchasing.

This project built up the Angular knowledge of routes and used the filtering
system to take a large set of data (all of our products) and allow us to display
just one of them inside of a details page.

This repo is finished
